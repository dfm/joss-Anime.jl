**A**tmospheric a**N**d **I**nstrumental models in the **M**easurement **E**quation - Anime - is an instrument modelling framework for radio interferometry written in Julia, an open source, high performance language for scientific computing. Anime aims to support efficient handling of various data formats commonly used in VLBI, provide seamless conversion between these formats and a variety of data products as output by a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) array, and integrate with other Julia-based calibration and Bayesian VLBI imaging software packages.
