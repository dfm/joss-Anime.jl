# Instrument Modelling and Synthetic Data Generation

Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) enables the highest angular resolution achievable in astronomy, up to ~20 Î¼as in the case of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) that produced the first ever images of a black hole in 2019. Since VLBI uses a sparse, heterogeneous array of radio telescopes located around the world, reconstructing images of observed astronomical sources is an ill-posed problem, and a deeper understanding of not only the astronomical source of interest but the instrument itself becomes crucial.

Detailed modelling of the instrument from first principles enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of any VLBI array. Synthetic observations which realistically represent the underlying physics that give rise to the observed data are necessary to understand the characteristics of an instrument, develop new algorithms for data analysis, and perform feasibility studies for future arrays and identify new sites for upgrading existing arrays.

## Radio Interferometer Measurement Equation
The Radio Interferometer Measurement Equation (RIME)[^HBS][^OMS] lies at the heart of modelling interferometric observations. A generic discrete RIME can be written as

```math
\mathbf{V}_{pq} = G_p \left( \sum_{s} E_{sp}\, \mathbf{X}_{spq}\, E_{sq}^H \right) G_q^H,
```

where the summation is carried out over all the sources $s$, and $\boldsymbol{E}_{sp}$ and $\boldsymbol{G}_p$ denote generic direction-dependent effects (DDEs) and direction-independent effects (DIEs) respectively. Each term is a $2\times2$ *Jones* matrix that describes any linear transformation acting on the incoming wave, and $H$ is the Hermitian conjugate.
